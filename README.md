# In-Process Refactoring of Experimentation Software

## What are we looking to accomplish?
1. Abstract basic functionality to streamline development of future experimentation software
2. Increase code reuse with functionality that is well generalized and well documented

## How are we going to do it?
1. Usage of [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html) documentation generator
2. Implementation of a micro-services architecture for hardware communication
